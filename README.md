<p>The program I hope to achieve will be "CastAway" a one stop shop for all fishing needs.  Included in this program will be types of fish in sections of water that you choose using an overlay on Google Earth, lures that will catch the fish and that are legal in that area, the size limits of each fish, and links to fishing gear websites as well as tutuorial videos for how to use the lures.</p>
